## 📅 Development History

### **June 3, 2024** - UI Polish & Data Architecture Overhaul

#### ✅ **Bundled JSON Data System**
- **Refactored data loading**: Replaced hardcoded dummy data with `assets/data/sampleProblems.json`
- **Created `sampleDataLoader.ts`**: Clean service for loading JSON problem sets
- **Maintained backward compatibility**: All existing database operations work unchanged
- **Enhanced offline capability**: Problems now truly bundled with app, no hardcoded data

#### ✅ **Home Tab Implementation**
- **Added fourth tab**: Home, Practice, Progress, Settings navigation
- **Welcome screen design**: Clean landing page with app branding and quick actions
- **Progress dashboard**: Shows solved/attempted problems and accuracy when available
- **Daily tips rotation**: Helpful learning tips that change each day deterministically
- **Navigation integration**: Quick access buttons to Practice and Settings tabs

#### 🔧 **Week 2 Goals - 100% Complete**
- ✅ **Navigation tabs**: Home, Practice, Progress, Settings
- ✅ **Bundled JSON problems**: Offline sample data system
- ✅ **SQLite integration**: Full persistence with progress tracking
- ✅ **Practice loop**: Question → answer → feedback cycle
- ✅ **Offline functionality**: Works in airplane mode, remembers progress

### **June 2, 2024** - Database Foundation

#### ✅ **SQLite Implementation Success**
- **Migrated from mock DB**: Fully functional SQLite database with WAL mode
- **Schema design**: Proper foreign keys, transactions, and type safety
- **Problem batch system**: Organized problem sets with metadata tracking
- **User progress persistence**: Comprehensive statistics and state management
- **Error handling**: Robust database operations with graceful failure recovery

#### ✅ **Database Architecture**
```sql
ProblemBatches (id, generationDate, sourceUrl, problemCount, importedAt)
Problems (id, batchId, equation, answer, solutionSteps, difficulty, problemType, isCompleted, userAnswer, createdAt, updatedAt)
UserProgress (id, currentBatchId, problemsAttempted, problemsCorrect, lastSyncTimestamp, createdAt, updatedAt)
```

### **Earlier Development** - Core Features

#### ✅ **Problem Solving Interface** (Week 1)
- **React Native app**: Clean, mobile-optimized UI for algebra problems
- **Answer validation**: Real-time feedback with numeric checking
- **Step-by-step solutions**: Collapsible solution guides using react-native-fast-collapsible
- **Expo Router navigation**: File-based routing with tab navigator

#### ✅ **State Management & Architecture**
- **Zustand store**: Global state management for problems and progress
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout application
- **Component library**: Reusable Button, ProblemContainer, FeedbackSection components
- **Error boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

#### ✅ **Development Tools**
- **EAS Build**: Multiple app variants (development, preview, production)
- **Mock database**: In-memory testing database for development
- **Linting & type checking**: ESLint and TypeScript strict mode
- **Development scripts**: Hot reloading, mock data seeding

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### **Tech Stack**
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo ~53.0
- **Database**: SQLite (expo-sqlite) with persistent storage
- **State**: Zustand for global state management
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with file-based routing
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Build**: EAS Build with multiple variants

## 🎯 Current Status

### **Functional Features**
- ✅ Four-tab navigation (Home, Practice, Progress, Settings)
- ✅ Algebra problem solving with answer validation
- ✅ Step-by-step solutions for incorrect answers
- ✅ Progress tracking with accuracy statistics
- ✅ SQLite persistence across app restarts
- ✅ Offline functionality with bundled problems
- ✅ Settings screen with progress reset capability

### **Problem Types Supported**
- `linear-one-variable`: Basic equations like "2x + 5 = 15"
- `quadratic-simple`: Simple quadratics like "x^2 - 4 = 0"
- Difficulty levels: `easy`, `medium` (with `hard` planned)

### **Data Management**
- **5 sample problems** loaded from JSON, organized in 2 batches
- **Progress persistence** with problems attempted/correct tracking
- **Batch-based problem selection** (currently "latest batch" strategy)
- **Complete offline operation** in airplane mode

## 🔮 Next Steps

### **Week 3+ Priorities**
- **Enhanced problem selection**: Topic-based filtering, difficulty progression
- **Expanded problem library**: More algebra topics and problem types
- **Learning analytics**: Detailed progress tracking and insights
- **Dynamic problem generation**: Server-side problem creation
- **Cloud sync**: Cross-device progress synchronization

### **Technical Improvements**
- **Performance optimization**: Problem caching and lazy loading
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Advanced offline**: Enhanced offline-first architecture
