## 🎯 Current Status

### **Functional Features**
- ✅ Four-tab navigation (Home, Practice, Progress, Settings)
- ✅ Algebra problem solving with answer validation
- ✅ Step-by-step solutions for incorrect answers
- ✅ Progress tracking with accuracy statistics
- ✅ SQLite persistence across app restarts
- ✅ Offline functionality with bundled problems
- ✅ Settings screen with progress reset capability

### **Problem Types Supported**
- `linear-one-variable`: Basic equations like "2x + 5 = 15"
- `quadratic-simple`: Simple quadratics like "x^2 - 4 = 0"
- Difficulty levels: `easy`, `medium` (with `hard` planned)

### **Data Management**
- **5 sample problems** loaded from JSON, organized in 2 batches
- **Progress persistence** with problems attempted/correct tracking
- **Batch-based problem selection** (currently "latest batch" strategy)

---

**Database Modes**:
- Production: SQLite with persistent storage
- Development: SQLite or mock (set `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DB=true`)
- Testing: In-memory mock database

## Problem Generation Improvements

The daily problem generation system has been enhanced to address several issues:

### Recent Improvements

1. **Robust JSON Parsing**: Fixed JSON parsing errors by handling OpenAI responses that sometimes include markdown formatting
2. **Answer Format Consistency**: Added specific instructions for each problem type to ensure consistent answer formats:
   - `linear-one-variable`: Single number (e.g., `3`)
   - `linear-two-variables`: Expression for x in terms of y (e.g., `"x = 3 + 2y"`)
   - `quadratic-factoring/formula`: Number or array of numbers (e.g., `[-1, -3]`)
   - `polynomial-simplification`: Simplified expression (e.g., `"2x^2 + 3x - 1"`)
3. **Calculator-Free Problems**: Enforced constraint that all problems must have integer or simple fraction answers (like 1/2, 2/3). NO complex decimals like 1.2839 that would require a calculator
4. **Upgraded Model**: Switched from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-4o` for better reliability
5. **Retry Logic**: Added automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed generations
6. **Better Error Handling**: Continue generation even if some problem types fail
7. **Enhanced Validation**: Validate answer formats match expected types and detect calculator-requiring answers
8. **Detailed Statistics**: Track success/failure rates and provide better debugging info
9. **LaTeX Output**: Problems and solution steps are now generated in LaTeX for rendering with `react-native-katex`

### Answer Quality Standards

All generated problems follow strict quality guidelines:

**✅ ACCEPTABLE ANSWERS:**
- Integers: `3`, `-2`, `0`, `7`
- Simple fractions: `1/2`, `2/3`, `3/4`, `5/6`
- Simple expressions: `"x = 3 + 2y"`, `"2x^2 + 3x - 1"`

**❌ UNACCEPTABLE ANSWERS:**
- Complex decimals: `1.2839`, `2.7182`, `0.3333...`
- Irrational numbers: `√2`, `√3`, `π`
- Calculator-requiring values: `3.14159`, `1.7320`

This ensures students focus on algebraic reasoning rather than arithmetic computation.

### Testing Locally

To test the problem generation locally before deploying:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-generation.js
   ```

This will generate a small batch of 5 problems and show detailed output including validation results.

### Monitoring Generation Quality

The system now provides detailed statistics after each run:
- Success rate percentage
- Failed problem types
- Answer format validation warnings
- Generation timing statistics

Check the GitHub Actions logs for these metrics after each daily run.
