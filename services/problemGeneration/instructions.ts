SOLUTION STEPS FORMAT:
Each step should be an object with three parts:
1. "explanation": Plain English description of what you're doing (e.g., "Add 5 to both sides")
2. "mathExpression": The actual math for this step in LATEX FORMAT (e.g., "x + 5 = 10" or "2x^2 + 3x - 1")
3. "isEquation": true if the expression contains "=", false if it's just an expression

EXAMPLES:
{
  "explanation": "Start with the original equation",
  "mathExpression": "2x + 3 = 11",
  "isEquation": true
}
{
  "explanation": "Subtract 3 from both sides",
  "mathExpression": "2x = 8",
  "isEquation": true
}
{
  "explanation": "Divide both sides by 2",
  "mathExpression": "x = 4",
  "isEquation": true
}

CRITICAL: LATEX FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS for MathLive Compatibility:
- For fractions: use \\frac{numerator}{denominator} NOT "3/4" format
  ✓ Correct: "\\frac{3}{4}", "x = \\frac{21}{3}", "\\frac{a}{3} = 7"
  ✗ Wrong: "3/4", "x = 21/3", "a/3 = 7"
- For square roots: use \\sqrt{expression} NOT "sqrt(expression)"
  ✓ Correct: "\\sqrt{16}", "\\sqrt{x + 1}"
  ✗ Wrong: "sqrt(16)", "sqrt(x + 1)"
- For exponents: use x^{2} or x^2 for simple exponents
  ✓ Correct: "x^2", "x^{2n + 1}", "(x + 1)^2"
- For multiplication: use implicit multiplication or \\cdot
  ✓ Correct: "2x", "3(x + 1)", "2 \\cdot 3"
- Use proper LaTeX spacing and grouping with braces when needed

LATEX EXAMPLES:
- Division: "\\frac{x + 1}{2}" instead of "(x + 1)/2"
- Mixed operations: "\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}" for quadratic formula
- Complex fractions: "\\frac{\\frac{1}{x}}{x + 1}" for nested fractions
- Equations with fractions: "\\frac{2x}{3} = \\frac{5}{6}"

This LaTeX format is required for proper rendering in MathLive math fields.
